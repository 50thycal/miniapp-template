# Farcaster Domain Manifest

This directory is reserved for the Farcaster domain manifest (`farcaster.json`).

## Important Notes

1. **The manifest is generated by the Farcaster client**, not manually created
2. You do not need to create `farcaster.json` yourself
3. The manifest is created when you register your domain with Farcaster
4. This directory must exist for the manifest to be served properly

## What goes in farcaster.json?

The Farcaster client generates a manifest with:
- Account association (links your domain to your FID)
- Frame metadata (if your app uses Frames)
- Signature verification data

## How to register your domain

1. Deploy your mini app to production
2. Use the Farcaster client to register your domain
3. The client will automatically create and sign the manifest
4. The manifest will be available at `https://your-domain.com/.well-known/farcaster.json`
